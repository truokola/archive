Abstracts will be published in the \emph{Proceedings of the XXXIX Annual
Conference of the Finnish Physical Society}, Report Series of the
Laboratory of Physics, Helsinki University of Technology.
The language of the abstracts is English.

Abstracts must be submitted to the organizers electronically, using
the file upload form at {\tt http://www.fyslab.hut.fi/fp2005/}.
Files prepared with \LaTeX\ in eps format or with Word in doc format
are accepted, as are also pdf files.
Submitted files will be published as they are. To maintain a coherent layout of
the proceedings all authors have to write the abstracts using this sample file
as a template.
The sample file is designed to produce correctly
formatted abstracts on an A4 page with line spacing 1 and 3 cm wide margins.
The font should be Times (New) Roman 12.
Those who use \LaTeX\ should prepare the final eps
file with the command \mbox{\tt dvips -E -o file.eps file.dvi}.

The title has to be written in bold capitals (the PACS code used previously
should not be included anymore). Title, authors, and address information have
to be separated from each other by an empty line. The name of the author
who will give the presentation has to be underlined. 
The email address of this author can be given on a separate line
below the address information.

The text has to be justified. Formulas have to be centered and, if numbering is
necessary, the number has to be placed on the right in parentheses.
References are cited in the text like this [1].
The reference list should use the format shown below.

%%% The following minipage structures are needed to position the figure
%%% beside the text paragraph.
%%% For a standard figure environment, see the example below.

\begin{minipage}{9cm}
Figures may be included in the submitted files. Here we show
how a figure can be included in a \LaTeX\ file.
