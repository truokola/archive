The rise of physical cosmology in the 20th century
</b></p>
<p><i>to 17.3. klo 19.00&#8211;20.00, Mellin-sali, TKK</i></p>
<p>Among the many remarkable developments in 20th-century physics, the
transformation of cosmology into a physical science is perhaps the most
remarkable. In the early years of the 20th century, cosmology scarcely existed
as a science, and even with Einstein's pathbreaking theory of 1917 it remained
a field of mathematics rather than physics. The change occurred in the 1930s,
inspired by attempts to understand the cosmochemical distribution of isotopes
and the energy production of the stars. It was progress in nuclear physics that
paved the way for the first physical models of the early universe, such as
formulated in 1948 by George Gamow and his associates. Since then, the
development has accelerated and early-universe cosmology has become ever closer
connected with nuclear and particle physics. The lecture will present an
overview of the development, mainly as it occurred between the 1920s and the
emergence of the hot big bang paradigm in the 1960s.

Spintronics in layered magnetic structures
</b></p>
<p><i>pe 18.3. klo 9.00&#8211;9.45, sali 1</i></p>
<p>Due to the presence of surfaces and interfaces in layered magnetic
structures there is a pronounced influence of the electron spin on other
electronic properties. In particular spindependent reflectivity is the
source of interlayer exchange coupling, spindependent bulk- and interface
scattering lead to Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR), spindependent tunneling
to Tunneling Magnetoresistance (TMR)  and spindependent transmission to
spin accumulation which can be used for current induced magnetic
switching. Applications are in the area of magnetic field sensors and
magnetic data storage. The current status of the field will be discussed.

Materials under pressure: new findings and phenomena
</b></p>
<p><i>pe 18.3. klo 9.45&#8211;10.30, sali 1</i></p>
<p>New static high-pressure techniques provide the ability to tune
interatomic and intermolecular interactions in condensed matter over a
broad range of conditions, from near zero pressure to &gt;300 GPa and
variable temperatures from cryogenic to thousands of degrees. Coupled with
the increasing array of measurements that can be performed under extreme
P-T conditions, including both new synchrotron and neutron techniques,
these investigations are resulting in new findings in structure, bonding,
and dynamics in solids, liquids, and fluids, as well as allowing the
creation and recovery of new materials. Examples include novel transitions
in atomic, diatomic, and polyatomic systems; structure and bonding in
molecular mixtures; pressure-induced metallization and superconductivity,
and unexpected discoveries in soft matter.

Recent progress in hardware for scalable quantum computers
</b></p>
<p><i>pe 18.3. klo 11.00&#8211;11.45, sali 1</i></p>
<p>Research on practical devices for quantum information processing is right
now going through a very interesting stage, in Europe and worldwide.
With ion traps one has recently been able to perform quantum operations with
up to four qubits, demonstrating multi-qubit entanglement, "tests" of
Bell inequalities, and teleportation.  A major issue concerns scalability:
can these systems be scaled to many qubits in order to outperform
ordinary computers on real tasks and hard problems?  
</p>
<p>On the other hand, solid-state mesoscopic quantum electronics is
making great progress: superconducting quantum circuits with
Josephson junctions have demonstrated highly accurate coherent
operation and readout of single qubits during microseconds,
two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, and systems with three
to five qubits will soon be tested. Moreover, experiments on
electron dynamics and spin-dependent transport in mesoscopic quantum
dots are showing very promising results for qubit implementations.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the next five years promise to be decisive for our 
understanding of how easy, or difficult, it will be to fight 
decoherence in small artificial quantum systems. It is
rather meaningless to try to predict how many qubits one
will be working with in 50 years, but one will soon know
whether ten-qubit systems, in ion/atom traps or solids,
are realistic for the year 2010. This talk will present some of
the evidence for why this may be a realistic proposition.

Mesoscopic Josephson junctions and devices at millikelvin temperatures

<p>First I am going to briefly introduce the activities at the Low Temperature
Laboratory of TKK on nanoelectronics in general. Then I move on to the
main part of my talk about phenomena in superconducting mesoscopic Josephson
junctions and SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices) and
recently invented devices based on these. Small size brings new effects
into play as compared to devices consisting of traditional superconducting
tunnel junctions: I focus on discussing single Cooper pair tunnelling
effects and dissipative quantum mechanics in small junctions at low
temperatures. The devices that are based on mesoscopic Josephson junctions
at low temperatures include current pumps ultimately for the metrological
quantum triangle of electrical quantities, threshold detectors for
electrical current and its noise, and various forms of ultrasensitive
amplifiers and detectors based on single electron (single Cooper pair)
transistor effects. Most notably mesoscopic Josephson junctions are
presently intensively investigated as promising candidates for implementing
quantum bit circuits.

Towards understanding and mimicking biopolymer functions: protein-like polymers
</b></p>
<p><i>pe 18.3. klo 12.30&#8211;13.15, sali 1</i></p>
<p>Recent years are characterized by a significant shift of the main
focus of polymer science from construction to functional polymers.
The requested functions of polymer systems are becoming more and more
sophisticated, giving rise to the term "smart polymers". From this
viewpoint the champions of "smartness" are biopolymers operating in
living systems (DNA, RNA, proteins), since the level of
sophistication of their functions is uncomparably higher than for any
synthetic polymers. Therefore, it is natural to adopt the so-called
biomimetic approach, i.e. to try to understand the principles of
functioning of biopolymers in living systems and to implement some of
the relevant ideas to synthetic polymers.
</p>
<p>This talk will give a review of some of the recent advances in
biomimetic polymers. In particular, I will focus on the polymers
mimicking globular proteins-enzymes (protein-like copolymers). First
problem was to realise such sequences in synthetic copolymers which
enable globule formation without precipitation. This problem was
solved due to the discovery of one-step process of "copolymerization
with simultaneous globule formation". At the next stage we tried to
arrange the conditions for enhanced catalytic function of obtained
protein-like globules. To this end we used amphiphilic monomer units
containing catalytically active groups. Due to the surface activity
of these units they are automatically inserted to globular interface.
In this case such interfaces act like surface nanoreactors, which are
especially effective for surface-active substrates. Finally, the
attempts to build-up a catalytically active center within surface
nanoreactors will be described.

Symmetries in nonlinear optics
</b></p>
<p><i>la 19.3. klo 11.30&#8211;12.15, sali 1</i></p>
<p>Nonlinear optical effects can occur when the optical properties of
materials depend on the presence of light. Second-order nonlinear effects,
such as second-harmonic generation, are electric-dipole-forbidden in
centrosymmetric materials. They are therefore sensitive probes of
surfaces and thin molecular films deposited on substrates, where the
symmetry is necessarily broken. In addition, the details of the nonlinear
response can be correlated with the more detailed structural properties of
such samples. We review several second-order nonlinear optical effects that
arise from the structural symmetry of thin films and surfaces.
</p><p>
Chiral molecules occur in two enantiomers that are mirror images of each
other. Such molecules interact differently with left- and right-hand
circularly-polarized light. We show that the efficiency of second-harmonic
generation from chiral thin films with in-plane isotropy is also different
for the two circular polarizations. However, such circular-difference effects
can occur also for achiral thin films with in-plane anisotropy when the
alignment of the sample breaks the reflection symmetry of the experimental
setup. The symmetry of the setup can also be broken with the polarization
of light.
</p><p>
Certain organic molecules form thin films that are both chiral and anisotropic.
We demonstrate how the contributions of these structural features to
second-harmonic generation can be separated through detailed investigations
of the nonlinear response. We also demonstrate that the nonlinear response
is extremely sensitive to chiral symmetry breaking arising from small-scale
structural defects of metal nanoparticles.
</p><p>
The symmetry properties of magnetic-dipole and electric-quadrupole
interactions are different from those of electric-dipole interactions.
Such higher-order interactions allow second-order nonlinear effects also
in centrosymmetric bulk materials. Separation between the bulk and surface
contributions to the nonlinear response is essential when second-order
processes are used as surface probes. We present a technique, which is
based on fundamental symmetry properties, to achieve an unambiguous and
quantitative separation of the surface and bulk contributions to the
nonlinear response.

What is inside a black hole?

<p><i>la 19.3. klo 12.15&#8211;13.00, sali 1</i></p>
<p>As argued many years ago by Hawking, black holes appear to
violate quantum mechanics by destroying
the reversibility of physical processes. Recent results in string
theory  however suggest a radically different picture of the black
hole interior;
  instead of being just `empty space with a central singularity', it
is now filled with a tangle of stringy matter. This picture
would resolve the `information paradox' raised by Hawking, and show
that quantum gravity effects are not confined to the planck length
but instead stretch over distances that increase with the mass of the
object being studied.</p>
